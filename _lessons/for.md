For loops repeat some code for every item in a sequence.

# Anatomy

The first line of a loop tells the computer how many times the loop will run. Each turn is called an **iteration**.

The **body** of the loop is any code that is indented past the loop's first line. The body gets repeated on each iteration.

**Code**

```python
for i in range(3):
    # This is the body
    print(i)
    # This will print three times
```

**Output**

```
0
1
2
```
