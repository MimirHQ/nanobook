# Writing to standard output

Now you will learn to use the standard output stream. The data your program **writes** to standard output can be:

- Recorded as the contents of a file
- Displayed to a user running the program in a system console
- Relayed as the input for another program

Since this stream is **standard**, you can use the same code to output data, regardless of its ultimate source.

## Writing a single line

To write a line to standard output, pass the line to the `print()` method as a string.

**Code**

```python
print('Here is the weather report for today:')
print('- It should be sunny outside')
print('- But honestly not sure')
```

**Output**

```
Here is the weather report for today:
- It should be sunny outside
- But honestly not sure
```

Each call to `print()` automatically adds a newline to the output stream. Adding the newline character `\n` adds an additional line break.

**Code**

```python
print('Here is the weather report for today:\n')
print('...')
print('Sorry, no idea what it will be like.')
```

**Output**

```
Here is the weather report for today:

...
Sorry, no idea what it will be like.
```

## Writing lines with formatted data

All data that gets printed must be a string. You can accomplish this by converting values to strings and/or **concatenating** (adding) smaller strings together.

**Code**

```python
temperature = 90.7
print('The temperature outside is ' + str(temperature) + ' today.')
```

**Output**

```
The temperature outside is 90.7 today.
```

But this kind of printing can become awkward and make the message in the code harder to read.

### Formatting ordered values

The fancy term for embedding data in a string is called **string interpolation**.

The `format()` method is a method that can be **called on** string values. This means that instead of calling the method and passing the string as an argument, you actually write the method after the string literal or variable. Formatting a string produces a new string with the inserted data. The syntax looks like this:

```python
# Calling format on a string literal
'string {} literal'.format(value)
```

```python
string_variable = 'some {} string'
string_variable.format(value)
```

The dot applies the method in the context of this specific string. The arguments of `format()` will be inserted into the new string at the locations of the `{}` symbols, replacing the curly braces in the order that they appear.

**Code**

```python
month = 'June'
day = 3
temperature = 90.7
print('It is {} {} and it is {} degrees outside.'.format(month, day, temperature))
```

**Output**

```
It is June 3 and it is 90.7 degrees outside.
```

To change the order of appearance in the string, add the number of the argument you want inside the `{}` braces. Remember that argument numbering starts at `0`.

**Code**

```python
month = 'June'
day = 3
temperature = 90.7
print('This is day {1} of {0} and it is {2} degrees outside.'.format(month, day, temperature))
```

**Output**

```
This is day 3 of June 3 and it is 90.7 degrees outside.
```

### Formatting named values

For more clarity, you may want to insert the values based on the names of the arguments to `format()`.

**Code**

```python
month = 'June'
day = 3
temperature = 90.7
message = 'This is day {day} of {month} and it is {temp} degrees outside.'
print(message.format(month=month, day=day, temp=temperature))
```

**Output**

```
This is day 3 of June 3 and it is 90.7 degrees outside.
```

## Writing escaped characters

Since we surround the contents of strings in quotation marks, it becomes awkward to use quotation marks in a message.

**Code**

```python
print('I love y'all')
```

**Output**

```
File "filename.py", line 1
    print('I love y'all')
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

The unpaired quotation marks will cause a `SyntaxError`.

A simple fix is to **escape** the troublesome symbol. You have already seen an **escaped character**, the newline `\n`. The backslash changes it from the letter n to a line break.

**Code**

```python
# added a backslash before the single quotation mark
print('I love y\'all')
```

**Output**

```
I love y'all
```
